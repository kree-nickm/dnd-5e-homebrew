# Ranger Beast Master
The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.

## Beast Master Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Beast Master Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Beast Master Spells
Ranger Level | Spells
------------ | ------
3rd | beast bond
5th | warding bond
9th | life transference
13th | locate creature
17th | commune with nature

Additionally, you can cast each spell once at its lowest level without expending a spell slot or using material components if you target your animal companion with the spell. You regain the ability to do this for all of these spells whenever you finish a short or long rest.

## Ranger’s Companion
You gain an animal companion that accompanies you on your adventures and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower. The beast’s statistics change in the following ways:

The beast gains proficiency in two saving throws: its highest attribute between Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom, as well as its highest attribute between Strength, Intelligence, and Charisma. If multiple scores are tied for highest, you choose one of them.

If the beast is proficient in less than three skills, it gains skill proficiencies until it has three. Choose the gained proficiencies from this list: acrobatics, athletics, perception, stealth, survival (the DM can include more skills if they make sense for your specific companion).

Add your proficiency bonus to the beast's AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in and any saving throw DCs of its abilities.

Its hit point maximum equals its normal maximum or five times your ranger level, whichever is higher.

The beast has a number of Hit Dice equal to your ranger level and can spend them during a short rest.

The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It shares a turn with you; both your and its movement and actions can happen in any order. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, or Help action. If you don't, the beast takes the Dodge action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action. Whenever the beast makes an attack as part of the Attack action, it counts as you having made an attack with a light melee weapon as part of the Attack action for the purpose of Two-Weapon Fighting.

If you are incapacitated or absent, your beast companion acts on its own, focusing on protecting you and itself. It never requires your command to use its reaction, such as when making an opportunity attack.

While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.

If your animal companion is ever slain, the magical bond you share allows you to return it to life. If you spend 2 hours during a long rest and expend 10 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food performing a ritual over its body (this is considered light activity), as long as it is not undead, you call forth your companion's spirit to return to its body. At the end of the long rest, your animal companion is restored to life with 1 hit point. This ritual neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting the creature when it died. It also closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

If you do not possess your companion’s body or it has become undead, you can perform a different ritual to create a new body for it. When you spend 8 hours and expend 100 gp worth of rare herbs and fine food performing this ritual, you create a new body and call your companion’s spirit to enter it. Your animal companion is restored to life with 1 hit point.

## Exceptional Training
Beginning at 7th level, the beast's attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition, on any of your turns when your beast companion doesn't attack, you can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage, or Help action. Alternatively, on any of your turns when you do not make an attack or cast a spell, you can use your bonus action to command your companion to make a single attack.

## Bestial Fury
Starting at 11th level, when your beast companion takes the Attack action, the beast can make two attacks, or it can take the Multiattack action if it has that action.

## Independant Fighters
Starting at 15th level, you no longer need to use an action or bonus action to issues commands to your beast. Your beast can freely use its actions to do anything that a creature can normally do.

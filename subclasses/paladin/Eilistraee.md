# Paladin of Eilistraee (Oath of Charity)
Eilistraee is the only drow goddess of good alignment, and she does her best to single-handedly balance out the evil of the entire rest of the drow pantheon. Most of her followers are drow who have turned away from the evils of Lolth, but she accepts followers of all races who seek to bring good into the world. Traditionally, only women would be granted spells by Eilistraee, but that restriction is no longer in place in the modern Forgotten Realms. She is a goddess of beauty, freedom, hunting, moonlight, and most importantly for this subclass, dance, song, and swordwork. A typical priest of Eilistraee is called a Dark Lady, or Reverent if male. Among them, a set of specialized clerics called Sword Dancers are expert sword fighters, who also perform songs and dances with their swords in the middle of combat in order to channel their spells.

Aside from that, all of her followers are expected to go above and beyond to prove to the world that drow are capable of good, and that there is a place for drow who wish to escape from the oppression of Lolth. Protect those in harm's way, give food to the hungry, and spread joy where ever you can. Do not mistake this kindness for pacifism however, as Sword Dancers are expected to repay violence with swift violence, thus quickly removing dangers and threats, so that the fewest might be hurt.

## Note: Below is a super early work-in-progress. I would not even call it a rough draft. It's basically just a set of placeholders to be changed later. Don't use it.

## Eilistraee Tenets

## Eilistraee's Holy Symbol
You can use any sword as a focus for your paladin spells.

## Channel Divinity: Spellsong
Starting at 3nd level, you can use your sword dance to duplicate the power of many spells.

As an action while you are wielding a sword, you can begin a song and dance with your sword and cast any cleric or paladin spell of 5th level or lower, expending a spell slot of the appropriate level. The spellsong must last for the spell's normal cast time, after which the spell takes effect.

During the spellsong, if it lasts longer than 1 round, you can move at half speed and take only the Disengage or Dodge actions, or an action unique to a specific effect (e.g. breaking from a grapple, ending the *phantasmal force* spell, etc.), and you cannot take reactions.

Instead of its normal components, the spell requires verbal, somatic, and material (your sword). However, if the spell normally requires material components of higher value than 100 gp, you must have them in sight and within 5 feet of you when you begin the spellsong, and they are consumed if the spell normally would require it.

If the spell requires concentration, you must maintain a simpler version of your spellsong for the duration, which does not restrict your ability to take actions or cast spells. You do not have to make checks to maintain concentration on this spell due to taking damage, but you lose concentration on the spell if you cannot maintain the spellsong (for example, if you enter the area of a *silence* spell or are restrained or disarmed).

## Channel Divinity: Turn the Unholy
As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

## Aura of Confidence
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened, charmed, and any effect that requires the target to hear the source.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

## Something...
Starting at 15th level...

## Ultimate Hunter
At 20th level, you can channel Eilistraee's power to become the ultimate hunter. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
- Your movement speed increases by 30 feet.
- Your movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

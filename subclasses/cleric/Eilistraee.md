# Cleric of Eilistraee (Sword Dancer Domain)
Eilistraee is the only drow goddess of good alignment, and she does her best to single-handedly balance out the evil of the entire rest of the drow pantheon. Most of her followers are drow who have turned away from the evils of Lolth, but she accepts followers of all races who seek to bring good into the world. Traditionally, only women would be granted spells by Eilistraee, but that restriction is no longer in place in the modern Forgotten Realms. She is a goddess of beauty, freedom, hunting, moonlight, and most importantly for this subclass, dance, song, and swordwork. A typical priest of Eilistraee is called a Dark Lady, or Reverent if male. Among them, a set of specialized clerics called Sword Dancers are expert sword fighters, who also perform songs and dances with their swords in the middle of combat in order to channel their spells.

Aside from that, all of her followers are expected to go above and beyond to prove to the world that drow are capable of good, and that there is a place for drow who wish to escape from the oppression of Lolth. Protect those in harm's way, give food to the hungry, and spread joy where ever you can. Do not mistake this kindness for pacifism however, as Sword Dancers are expected to repay violence with swift violence, thus quickly removing dangers and threats, so that the fewest might be hurt.

## Alternate Start
If this is your starting class, your saving throw proficiencies are Dexterity and Charisma instead of Wisdom and Charisma. Because Eilistraee is a performance-based deity, your spellcasting ability is Charisma, not Wisdom.

If you are using the Starting Equipment rule, use these options instead of the normal options for a cleric:
* (a) a two-handed sword or (b) two one-handed swords
* (a) scale mail, (b) chain shirt or (c) leather armor
* (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* A holy symbol and another one-handed sword

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose Eilistraee as your deity at 1st level, you gain proficiency with all swords (greatsword, longsword, shortsword, rapier, scimitar, etc.) and in the Performance skill.

## Sword Dancer
You can use any sword as a focus for your cleric spells.

You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks that use a sword without the heavy property.

As a bonus action on your turn, if you are not wielding a shield and not wearing medium or heavy armor, you can begin a defensive sword dance. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 bonus to your armor class. The sword dance ends early if you stop wielding a sword. Additonally, if you would be hit by an attack or fail a Dexterity saving throw while this sword dance persists, you can use a reaction to give yourself a bonus to your AC against that attack or to that Dexterity saving throw equal to your proficiency bonus. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, and you regain expended uses when you finish a short rest.

## Channel Divinity: Spellsong
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your sword dance to duplicate the power of many spells.

As an action while you are wielding a sword, you can begin a song and dance with your sword and cast any cleric spell of 6th level or lower, expending a spell slot of the appropriate level. The spellsong must last for the spell's normal cast time, after which the spell takes effect.

During the spellsong, if it lasts longer than 1 round, you can move at half speed and take only the Disengage or Dodge actions, or an action unique to a specific effect (e.g. breaking from a grapple, ending the *phantasmal force* spell, etc.) The only reaction you can take during your spellsong is your Sword Dancer feature.

Instead of its normal components, the spell requires verbal, somatic, and material (your sword). However, if the spell normally requires material components of higher value than 100 gp, you must have them in sight and within 5 feet of you when you begin the spellsong, and they are consumed if the spell normally would require it.

If the spell requires concentration, you must maintain a simpler version of your spellsong for the duration, which does not restrict your ability to take actions or cast spells. You do not have to make checks to maintain concentration on this spell due to taking damage, but you lose concentration on the spell if you cannot maintain the spellsong (for example, if you enter the area of a *silence* spell or are restrained or disarmed).

## Extra Attack
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Divine Strike
At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

## Master Sword Dancer
At 17th level, your Spellsong can ignore spell material components that cost up to 1000 gp. Additionally, your Sword Dancer reaction can be used even if you did not use a bonus action to begin the defensive sword dance on your turn, in which case the sword dance is activated as part of that reaction. Lastly, there is no longer a limit to how many times you can use your Sword Dancer reaction.

# Cleric of Eilistraee (Sword Dancer Domain)
Eilistraee is the only drow goddess of good alignment, and she does her best to single-handedly balance out the evil of the entire rest of the drow pantheon. Most of her followers are drow who have turned away from the evils of Lolth, but she accepts followers of all races who seek to bring good into the world. Traditionally, only women would be granted spells by Eilistraee, but that restriction is no longer in place in the modern Forgotten Realms. She is a goddess of beauty, freedom, hunting, moonlight, and most importantly for this subclass, dance, song, and swordwork. A typical priest of Eilistraee is called a Dark Lady, or Reverent if male. Among them, a set of specialized clerics called Sword Dancers are expert sword fighters, who also perform songs and dances with their swords in the middle of combat in order to channel their spells.

Aside from that, all of her followers are expected to go above and beyond to prove to the world that drow are capable of good, and that there is a place for drow who wish to escape from the oppression of Lolth. Protect those in harm's way, give food to the hungry, and spread joy where ever you can. Do not mistake this kindness for pacifism however, as Sword Dancers are expected to repay violence with swift violence, thus quickly removing dangers and threats, so that the fewest might be hurt.

## Alternate Start
If this is your starting class, your saving throw proficiencies are Dexterity and Charisma instead of Wisdom and Charisma.

If you are using the Starting Equipment rule, use these options instead of the normal options for a cleric:
* (a) a two-handed sword or (b) two one-handed swords
* (a) scale mail, (b) chain shirt or (c) leather armor
* (a) a priest's pack or (b) an explorer's pack
* A holy symbol and another one-handed sword

## Bonus Proficiencies
When you choose Eilistraee as your deity at 1st level, you gain proficiency with all swords (greatsword, longsword, shortsword, rapier, scimitar, etc.) and in the Performance skill.

## Sword Dancer
You can use Charisma instead of Wisdom for all cleric features, and you can use any sword as a focus for your cleric spells.

While you are not wearing heavy armor and not wielding a shield, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your melee weapon attacks that use a sword without the heavy property.

When you would be hit with an attack while you are wielding a sword, not wearing heaving armor, and not wielding a shield, you can use a reaction to make a Charisma (Performance) check and use that result in place of your AC against this attack. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Channel Divinity: Spellsong
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your sword dance to duplicate the power of many spells.

As an action while you are wielding a sword, you can begin a song and dance with your sword and cast any cleric spell of 6th level or lower, expending a spell slot of the appropriate level. The spellsong must last for the spell's normal cast time, after which the spell takes effect.

During the spellsong, if it lasts longer than 1 round, you can move at half speed and take only the Disengage or Dodge actions, or an action unique to a specific effect (e.g. breaking from a grapple, ending the *phantasmal force* spell, etc.) The only reaction you can take during your spellsong is your Sword Dancer feature.

Instead of its normal components, the spell requires verbal, somatic, and material (your sword). However, if the spell normally requires material components of higher value than 100 gp, you must have them in sight and within 5 feet of you when you begin the spellsong, and they are consumed if the spell normally would require it.

If the spell requires concentration, you must maintain a simpler version of your spellsong for the duration, which does not restrict your ability to take actions or cast spells. You do not have to make checks to maintain concentration on this spell due to taking damage, but you lose concentration on the spell if you cannot maintain the spellsong (for example, if you enter the area of a *silence* spell or are restrained or disarmed).

## Battle Hardened
Starting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with a sword.

Also starting at 6th level, you can add your proficiency bonus to Contitution saving throws that you make to maintain concentration. If you are already proficient in Constitution saving throws, your proficiency bonus is doubled for those saving throws.

## Divine Strike
Starting at 8th level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any Charisma (Performance) check using a sword.

## Sword Enchanter
At 14th level, you gain the ability to enchant swords. While you are outdoors at night, you can perform a special dance with a sword. The dance lasts for 1 hour and deals 4 damage to you as you draw blood from each limb during it. Once finished, the sword becomes magical for 3 months and glows with silvery dim light within 5 feet. Alternatively, you can transform the sword into a singing sword (see below). You can only enchant one singing sword at a time. If you enchant another, the previous one loses its magic.

> ### Singing Sword
> *Weapon (any sword), requires attunement by a follower of Eilistraee*
> 
> This magical sword literally sings when drawn, radiates with silvery fire, and gives off dim light within 10 feet. This sword deals radiant damage instead of its normal damage type.
> 
> While wielding this sword, you are immune to being charmed and frightened. Additionally, if you are subject to any effect that requires you to hear the source, you can choose not to be affected.

## Master Sword Dancer
At 17th level, your Spellsong can ignore spell material components that cost up to 1000 gp. Additionally, you now regain all expended uses of your Sword Dancer feature on a short rest.

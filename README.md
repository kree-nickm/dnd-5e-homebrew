# Kryand's D&D 5E Homebrew
A collection of various homebrew that I've made, used, or plan to used. No, it's not a programming project, who said GitHub has to be for programming projects?

## Subclasses
* [Cleric of Eilistraee](subclasses/cleric/Eilistraee.md) - If you want to be a lore-accurate sword dancer priest of Eilistraee, your options are either College of Swords Bard or Bladesinger Wizard. But neither of those things is a cleric, so, here's one.
* [Ranger Beast Master](subclasses/ranger/BeastMaster.md) - Everyone agrees this subclass is the worst in the entire game of 5E D&D. Many DMs have tried to buff it. Here's my attempt.

## Races
* [Pixie](races/Pixie.md) - An untested set of stats for a character I was going to play, with DM approval. It's like the pixie from the Monster Manual, but for a PC.
* [Sentient Magic Item](races/SentientMagicItem.md) - If you're looking for a major secret that you can keep from the party, try this on for size. I'm not even a person, I'm the item that the person is holding!

## Misc
* [Rebalanced Feats](Feats.md) - I hate some feats. Rather than banning them, I tried to change them so that I no longer hate them.

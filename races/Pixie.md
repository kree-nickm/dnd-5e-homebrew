# Pixie
**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score decreases by 4, your Dexterity score increases by 3, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Divide another 2 ability score increases among your Constitution, Intelligence, and Wisdom.

**Age.** Any age you want.

**Alignment.** A pixie’s love for the joys of life causes it to strongly tend toward good alignments. Its love of freedom and trickery generally prevent it from being lawful.

**Size.** Your size is Tiny. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. Halve your carrying capacity and the amount you can push, drag, or lift.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 10 feet, and you have a fly speed of 30 feet. If you fly while visible, a shower of sparkling dust follows in your wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star.

**Fey.** Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Pixie Spells.** You know the *druidcraft* cantrip. The following spells are added to your class’ spell list for you: *confusion*, *dancing lights*, *detect evil and good*, *detect thoughts*, *dispel magic*, *entangle*, *fly*, *phantasmal force*, *polymorph*, *sleep*.

You use your pixie dust as the material component for any spell you cast, unless the material component is consumed and has a gold piece cost, or is highly specific (such as the *plane shift* spell).

**Invisibility.** As an action, you can magically turn invisible until you attack, cast a spell, or your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you.

**Opposed to Violence.** You cannot make attack rolls.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.

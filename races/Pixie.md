# Pixie
**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score decreases by 4, your Dexterity score increases by 3, and your Charisma score increases by 2. Divide another 2 ability score increases among your Constitution, Intelligence, and Wisdom.

**Age.** Any age you want.

**Alignment.** A pixie’s love for the joys of life causes it to strongly tend toward good alignments. Its love of freedom and trickery generally prevent it from being lawful.

**Size.** Your size is Tiny. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class. Halve your carrying capacity and the amount you can push, drag, or lift.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 10 feet, and you have a fly speed of 30 feet. If you fly while visible, a shower of sparkling dust follows in your wake like the glittering tail of a shooting star.

**Fey.** Your creature type is fey, rather than humanoid. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Pixie Spells.** You know the *druidcraft* cantrip. The following spells are added to your class’ spell list for you: *confusion*, *dancing lights*, *detect evil and good*, *detect thoughts*, *dispel magic*, *entangle*, *fly*, *phantasmal force*, *polymorph*, *sleep*.

All spells you cast have altered range, area-of-effect, targeting requirements, and components. The components for all of your spells are changed to: M (pixie dust), unless the material component has a gold piece cost greater than 10 times your character level. In order to affect any creature other than yourself with a spell, you must sprinkle your pixie dust on them, which you can throw within 5 feet of you and falls up to 10 feet downward. You must also do this for spells that affect multiple creatures, even if the spell normally affects a radius. Every creature you want to affect must be sprinkled with pixie dust, but you can sprinkle multiple creatures with the same action, and you can move normally during the casting of the spell to get within reach.

**Invisibility.** As an action, you can magically turn invisible until you attack, cast a spell, or your concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you.

**Opposed to Violence.** You cannot make attack rolls.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.

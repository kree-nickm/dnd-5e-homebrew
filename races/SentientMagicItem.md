# Sentient Magic Item
Most sentient magic items can be used like any normal item, and the only effect that the sentience has on the wielder is a voice in their head. Occasionally, a sentient magic item can influence the actions of their wielder for brief periods of time if the wielder’s will is not strong enough. However, you are a special kind of sentience. You can exert permanent control over your host, to the point that your host loses all awareness and control of themselves until you see fit to allow it. You also can learn new abilities in the form of class levels, and you can use those abilities through your host.

The explanation for how your consciousness came to inhabit this item can be as varied as your form. Perhaps you were created from nothingness by a deity and stuffed into a mask, and you use ever-increasing cleric powers granted to you by that deity to subsume the will of anyone who wears you. Perhaps you were a novice wizard attempting to create a magic cloak far outside your expertise, and the magic backfired and trapped your soul in the cloak instead, though still allowing you to retain some of your wizard features and continue to develop them. Or perhaps you are the type of ancient, powerful, sentient weapon that allows a person to become a hexblade warlock, but rather than granting them power as a normal hexblade, you instead dominate them, and the warlock powers they display are entirely your own.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your starting ability scores represent your mental attributes and the physical attributes of your initial host. Your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma increases by 2, and the other two both increase by 1. Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution each decrease by 1. If you gain any features that would change your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution scores, your magic item form instead permanently gains a property that grants that change to the creature attuned to you.

**Age.** As an object, age is meaningless to you. Perhaps you were created within the past few days, or perhaps you’ve been around for thousands of years.

**Alignment.** The fact that you generally possess living creatures against their will makes it unlikely that you are either good or lawful. However, depending on your criteria for choosing a host, arguments could be made for any alignment.

**Size.** You choose a form, which can be a Tiny or Small object that can be worn or carried by a Medium creature.

**Speed.** Your speed is 0, and you cannot benefit from bonuses to your speed.

**Creature Sense.** You can hear, and you have blindsight out to 30 feet (blind beyond that radius). You can also sense whether or not you are capable of possessing any creature that you can see.

**Communication.** You have telepathy with any creature that touches, wears, or carries you. You can also communicate emotions to any creature that you can see.

**Languages.** You know Common and one other language, but you cannot speak unless it is through your host. Additionally, while you are possessing a creature, you know any languages that it knows.

**Item Nature.** You do not require air, food, drink, or sleep. Your host still does, if it normally would. Your statistics differ depending on whether or not you are currently possessing a creature.

While you are not possessing a creature, you are a construct. Your AC is equal to 10 plus half your level (rounded down), plus 1 if you are Tiny. Your maximum hit points are equal to either 4 times your level if you are Tiny, or 5 times your level if you are Small. Your Strength and Dexterity become 1 and cannot be increased or reduced, and you automatically fail any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw based on Strength or Dexterity. Your Constitution becomes 10, and you have advantage on all ability checks and saving throws based on Constitution. You are immune to being charmed, exhausted, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, knocked unconscious, or put to sleep. You are permanently prone. You have immunity to poison and psychic damage and resistance to any nonmagical damage. You cannot take any actions or reactions except for Possess. At the discretion of the DM, you may also lose access to some of your class features, or retain use of certain actions granted by your class. You follow the normal rules for resting, though you only need to spend the duration taking no actions rather than sleeping. If you drop to 0 hit points, you are destroyed.

While you are possessing a creature, you are considered to be that creature, and you are treated as a magic item attuned to that creature (see Properties As An Item). If you are in an antimagic field or similar area that suppresses the properties of magic items, your consciousness ceases to exist until you are removed from that area, and you become a nonmagical item during that time. Your host is no longer possessed while either of you are in such an area. If you are both subsequently removed from that area, assuming your attunement to each other hasn’t ended, you can use an action to regain possession of your host if it is within 100 feet of you. You follow the same rules for resting as your host, though you do not need to sleep; you remain aware while your host is unconscious. If your host dies, the possession ends, and you return to being a construct as above with your full hit points.

**Possess.** As a reaction, you can attempt to possess a humanoid that touches you. You can also use an action to do the same while the humanoid continues to touch, carry, or wear you. Creatures immune to being charmed are immune to this effect. If the target is not willing, it must make a Charisma saving throw against your class’ spell save DC (choose a class if you have more than one). If your class has no spell save DC, the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency + your Charisma modifier. On a successful save, you cannot attempt to possess that creature again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature becomes your host. You control that creature as though it was yourself, you learn any information that you could gain if the creature had failed a saving throw against detect thoughts, and you are now treated as a magic item to which that creature is immediately attuned (See Properties As An Item). If it has no more attunement slots, it loses attunement with an item of your choice. The creature’s statistics are replaced with your own, with the following exceptions:
* It retains its size, type, speed, and senses.
* It retains its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores.
* It retains any racial features that are part of the creature’s very nature (DM discretion; e.g. a dwarf might retain Dwarven Resilience but not Stonecunning).
* The creature does not benefit from your Creature Sense or Communication traits.
* The creature does not gain any of your resistances or immunities that were granted by your Item Nature.
* The creature gains advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

> **Note:** The DM can simply decide that you aren’t allowed to possess certain NPCs or PCs and have them automatically succeed on their saving throw. Additionally, the DM might also allow some possessed creatures to repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, ending their attunement and possession on a success. In return for you being able to possess a creature indefinitely with almost no chance of it breaking free, you have to accept only being able to possess certain creatures that don’t result in the campaign falling apart. You are intended to attempt to keep the same host throughout the entire campaign, only possessing a new one if you have no other choice.

**Greater Possession.** At 11th level, you can possess more than just humanoids. You can attempt to possess any non-humanoid creature whose challenge rating is less than your character level divided by 4, as long as it is capable of wearing or carrying you, as is appropriate for your form.

**Final Form.** At 17th level, you become an artifact. You can no longer be destroyed except by a very specific set of circumstances. If you are reduced to 0 hit points as a construct, you become incapacitated until you regain hit points. Discuss with the DM what an appropriate condition would be for your destruction. It should be something that has significance to your creation or your path to gaining this level of power. You are no longer affected by antimagic field and similar magical effects as described in your Item Nature, and your host is not freed from your possession in those areas.

At 17th level and each level thereafter, your magic item form gains a minor detrimental and/or beneficial property. Additionally, at 18th and 20th level, you gain a major detrimental and/or beneficial property. These properties are at the discretion of the DM, and which ones you gain will likely depend on your alignment and other personality traits.

> ### Properties As An Item
> *Requires Attunement*
> 
> **Return.** If this item is within 100 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to return it to you. You can return it to your hands or onto the appropriate part of your body.
> 
> **Disguise.** While attuned to this item, you gain the effects of disguise self.
> 
> **Sentience.** The item’s alignment and ability scores are determined at its creation. The item shares your senses as long as you are within 100 feet of the item and not unconscious. Otherwise, the item has hearing and blindsight out to a range of 30 feet, but is blind beyond that radius.
> 
> The item communicates telepathically with you and can understand Common and one other language, as well as any language that you know. The item can also communicate telepathically with anyone who is touching it. If you are further than 100 feet from the item or unconscious, the item can communicate emotions to creatures within 30 feet.
> 
> **Personality.** The item’s personality is determined at its creation. Generally, it takes possession of whoever attunes to it and affords them no free will. If removed from its attuner’s possession, it almost always forces them to immediately use the Return property to retrieve it. It forces the attuner take on a magical disguise of its choosing, usually the same appearance regardless of who is attuned to it.

# Rebalanced Feats
There are a few feats that don't seem too well designed to me, and every time I've ever seen them used, they pretty much break the game. So, I tried to rebalance them a bit.

### Sharpshooter
You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:
* The normal range of your weapon is doubled (long range remains the same).
* Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover within your weaponâ€™s new normal range.
* Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a penalty to the attack roll equal to your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you add double your proficiency bonus to the attack's damage.

### Sentinel
You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits:
* When you hit a creature that is one size larger than you or smaller with an opportunity attack, you can choose to knock the creature prone instead of dealing damage.
* Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach, but you cannot choose to knock them prone if they do.
* When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
